# my-awesome-todo

A seemingly ordinary TODO application, nothing interesting. However, I had a TON of fun with it and learned a lot of things. At the very beginning when I finished it, it seemed boring and empty, so I decided that I will add animations of completing and deleting tasks, which meant that I had to study methods of animating things in JavaScript. Next, I dreamed of having the tasks stay saved, even when the browser window was closed. For this I needed localstorage and the basics of json, which made me take a deeper interest in json's capabilities, leading to me learning somewhat basics of it.
